🟢 Tier 1: Absolute Must-Do (Foundations)

These teach you all the classic pointer tricks:

206. Reverse Linked List (Easy) → the “Hello World” of linked lists.

207. Middle of the Linked List (Easy) → slow/fast pointer intro.

208. Linked List Cycle (Easy) → detect loop (Floyd’s algo).

209. Linked List Cycle II (Med.) → find starting node of loop.

210. Remove Nth Node From End of List (Med.) → two-pointer technique.

211. Merge Two Sorted Lists (Easy) → dummy node pattern.

212. Palindrome Linked List (Easy) → slow/fast + reverse second half.

213. Intersection of Two Linked Lists (Easy/Med.) → pointer switching trick.

👉 Master these and you’ll crack 70% of Linked List interview questions.

🟡 Tier 2: Strong Learning / Common in Interviews

More pointer gymnastics + variations:

2. Add Two Numbers (Med.) → simulates addition with carry.

3. Reverse Linked List II (Med.) → reverse a sublist.

4. Swap Nodes in Pairs (Med.) → practice node swaps.

5. Reverse Nodes in k-Group (Hard) → advanced reversal pattern.

6. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II (Med.) → clean-up trick.

7. Reorder List (Med.) → middle + reverse + merge.

8. Odd Even Linked List (Med.) → stable reordering.

9. Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List (Med.) → middle + reverse + pair sum.

🔴 Tier 3: For Deep Practice / Advanced

Good if you want to go beyond interviews:

138. Copy List with Random Pointer (Med.) → tricky, pointer weaving.

139. Sort List (Med.) → merge sort with linked list.

140. Add Two Numbers II (Med.) → addition but without reversing list.

141. Split Linked List in Parts (Med.) → splitting logic.

142. Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List (Med.) → recursion + pointers.

143. Insert into a Sorted Circular Linked List (Med.) → edge-case fun.
